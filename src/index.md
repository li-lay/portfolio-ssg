# LILAY

### Junior Computer Science @ [`AKUKS`](https://akuks.com)

I'm Lilay, I like **Linux** and **homelabbing** (lol). Base in Kampong Speu, **Cambodia**, I live for the rush of creating and uncovering new adventures. From open-source projects to tinkering with hardware in my homelab.

- **DevOps** <3
- Daily‑driving Linux since high school
- Self-Hosting stuff, btw
- And uhh... I use **Neovim**, btw
